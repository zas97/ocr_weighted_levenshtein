# Ocr weighted Levenshtein distance

## Getting started

Install the weighted_levenshtein library :

    pip install weighted-levenshtein

Download json with the params for the weighted levenshtein from https://github.com/zas97/ocr_weighted_levenshtein/blob/main/params_weighted_leven.json

### Usage

```python
import json
from weighted_levenshtein import lev
import numpy as np

with open("../params_weighted_leven.json", "r") as f:
    leven_params = json.load(f)
    for k in params.keys():
        leven_params[k] = np.array(leven_params[k])
    leven_params

## Order of the words to compare matter matter :
## To get the correct distance use 
# lev("word_in_ocr", "word_to_match", **leven_params)

print(lev("rat", "cat", **leven_params)) ## prints 1.16
print(lev("eat", "cat", **leven_params)) ## prints 0.57
print(lev("Bat", "8at", **leven_params)) ## prints 0.46
print(lev("hello", "hell0", **leven_params)) ## prints 0.13
print(lev("What", "what", **leven_params)) ## prints 0.26
print(lev("hello", "helloi", **leven_params)) ## prints 0.24
print(lev("hello", "helloH", **leven_params)) ## prints 0.83
``` 

## Use Cases

The Levenshtein distance is often used to search words in ocrised texts in fault tolerant manner. For example if we are searching for the word THEATRE in an image with text, the ocr will sometimes recognize words like THEATRF or T4EATRE. To match also this words a common tactic is to search any word that is at a Levenshtein distance 1 from THEATRE. However, in this use case not all edit operation should have the same cost, the word THEATRF should be closer to the word THEATRW since the ocr is more likely to confuse an F from E than a W from an E.
